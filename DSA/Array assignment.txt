1. Write a C++ program to find the largest element of a given array of integers
2. Write a C++ program to find the largest three elements in an array.
3. Write a C++ program to find k largest elements in a given array of integers.
4.  Write a C++ program to find the most occurring element in an array of integers
5. Write a C++ program to update every array element by multiplication of next and previous values of a given array of integers
6. Write a C++ program to find the two repeating elements in a given array of integers.
7. Write a menu driven C++ program to do following operation on two dimensional array A of size m x n. You should use user-defined functions which accept 2-D array A, and its size m and n as arguments. The options are:

   a. To input elements into matrix of size m x n
   b. To display elements of matrix of size m x n
   c. Sum of all elements of matrix of size m x n
   d. To display row-wise sum of matrix of size m x n
   e. To display column-wise sum of matrix of size m x n
  f. To create transpose of matrix B of size n x m
8. Write a user defined function named Upper-half() which takes a two dimensional array A, with size N rows and N columns as argument and prints the upper half of the array.
e.g.,
2 3 1 5 0                              2 3 1 5 0
7 1 5 3 1                                 1 5 3 1
2 5 7 8 1   Output will be:    		    1 7 8
0 1 5 0 1                                     0 1
3 4 9 1 5                                       5

9. Write a program to multiply array A and B of order NxL and LxM
