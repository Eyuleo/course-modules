Searching algorithms implementation
Sorting algorithms implementation


//Sample Menu for your program

Here different operations on list
1. Searching algorithms implementation
	//sub-menu
	i. sequential search
	ii. Binary search
	iii. Recursive binary search
	iv. Binary search (for list sort order in descending order)

2. Sorting algorithms implementation

	// sub-menu
	i. Bubble sort
	ii. Bubble sort (the smallest bubble up..> descending order)
	ii. Insertion sort
	iii. selection sort



Notes: Add comments to clarify your codes whenever necessary.
Your program should be menu driven as given above.
